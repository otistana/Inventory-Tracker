# Inventory Tracker

A simple inventory tracking web application built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Why I Built This
I built this project as a personal weekend build to practice JavaScript fundamentals, and working with browser localStorage. The goal was to better understand how data can persist in a web app even after the page is refreshed.

This project helped me move beyond tutorials and actually think through how an application manages and updates its data.

## Features
- Add inventory items through a form
- Display items in a table
- Edit item quantity
- Delete inventory items
- Persist data using browser localStorage so items remain after refresh

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Browser LocalStorage API

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser

No additional setup or dependencies required.

## What I Learned
- How to separate data (state) from UI rendering
- How to dynamically create and update DOM elements
- How to use localStorage to save and load application data
- How small logic placement issues can impact application behavior

## Future Improvements
- Add form input validation
- Improve UI styling
- Add confirmation before deleting items
- Add search or filter functionality
